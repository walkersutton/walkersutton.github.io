## 👋 Intro
* 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a software engineer on the SMB team at [Flexport](https://flexport.com).
* 🏡 I'm originally from the [East End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_End_(Long_Island)) of Long Island.
* 🎓 I studied Computer Science at Northeastern University.

## 😄 Fun
* 🏃 Running
* 🚴 Cycling
* 🪁🏄 Kiteboarding
* 🧩 Crossword Puzzles

## 🚧 Current Projects
* GPX video overlay tool (in progress)
* Simple clone of an existing SAAS (idea / ~began implementation)
* Y Combinator pitch (idea)

## 🏚 Projects in shambles
* 🚴 [Cadence Calculator](https://github.com/walkersutton/cadence-calculator) - Generate cadence data for your fixed gear Strava activities. A better understanding of Strava API derailed this project. Read about [what's wrong with the Strava API](https://walkersutton.com/coming_soon).
* 🐦 [@WePollUs](https://twitter.com/wepollus) - A Twitter bot that generates crowdsourced polls. I might revive this project. If you're interested in working on this, please reach out.
