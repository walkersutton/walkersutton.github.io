## 👋 Hey!
* 🏡 I'm originally from the [East End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_End_(Long_Island)) of Long Island.
* 🏔️ I live in Seattle, WA
* 👨🏻‍💻 [Tech career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walkersutton)
* 🚴🏻‍♂️ [Amateur athlete](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2700105)

## 🛠️ Useful Things I've Built
* 📹 [Cyclemetry](https://github.com/walkersutton/cyclemetry) - CLI tool for creating cycling telemetry video overlays

* 📖 playing with RSS feeds: [curious fucks](https://curiousfucks.com)
* 🪚 building a shelf

## 🏚 Projects in Shambles
* 🚴 [Cadence Calculator](https://github.com/walkersutton/cadence-calculator) - Generate cadence data for your fixed gear Strava activities. A better understanding of Strava API derailed this project. Read about [what's wrong with the Strava API](https://walkersutton.com/coming_soon).
* 🐦 [@WePollUs](https://twitter.com/wepollus) - A Twitter bot that generates crowdsourced polls. I might revive this project. If you're interested in working on this, please reach out.
