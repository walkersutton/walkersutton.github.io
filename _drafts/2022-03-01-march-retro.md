_This is the beginning of an attempt to mimic [Michael Lynch's retrospectives](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/). Hopefully this can help me achieve some of my goals, and maybe someone can find some value in it as well._

It's a bit late to be writing this, but better late than never. Hopefully next month, I'll be more on top of it.

## February Highlights
* I helped launch my parent's website for their [new inn](https://theinnatorient.com)
* [@wepollus](https://twitter.com/wepollus) Revival
* [Fweb3](https://fweb3.xyz)

### The Inn at Orient
My parents sold their house last spring and bought an inn! They've been doing lots of renovations over the past year, and just a few weeks ago, they welcomed their first guests. I was tasked with helping them get their business online. I initially thought it might be fun to build their property management/online booking system, but we ended up going with a 3rd party as I grossly understimated the amount of work that would go into building this.

We chose to use [Cloud Beds](https://cloudbeds.com) to handle the bulk of online reservations. It certainly isn't a perfect piece of software - there's a lot of manual configuration that needs to be done for each booking channel that you integrate with. I'm not sure if this is simply because online travel agencies (OTAs) have limited APIs or if Cloud Beds just decided it was easier to do the bare minimum. I tried to look at Airbnb's API documentation, but it seems like their docs aren't public and unfortunately, it also seems difficult to gain access to their API.

I think there might be a gap in the market here. You could build a 'Plaid for OTAs', assuming that you could provide Cloud Beds and other hotel management services value by making it easier for them to support all endpoints for all OTAs.

### @wepollus Revival
I built a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/wepollus) in 2020 that generates Twitter polls based on user interactions. A few months ago, the bot broke because of some changes to the Twitter website. I ended up putting the bot on pause for a while and decided it was time to revive @wepollus last month. I learned that at some point over the last year or so, the Twitter API was updated with a new endpoint that supports creating Twitter polls. This was great news to hear because the broken component was doing just this - but instead of using the API, it was using Selenium. I'm happy to report that the bot is now back up. Also very happy that I no longer need Selenium to achieve this functionality since the API should significantly reduce the amount of time I need to invest in maintaining this code.

### Fweb3
During the month of February, I participated in a game called [Fweb3](https://fweb3.xyz). I found out about it through [Sahil](https://twitter.com/shl/tweetlink) on Twitter; it seemed like a good opportunity for me to learn more about web3, ethereum, ... . At the beginning, there really wasn't much of a plan for what was to come. But as the month went on, bits and pieces started coming together into a fully-fledged game. I was introduced to a lot of new concepts and technologies that I otherwise wouldn't have learned about as easily on my own...... TODO

## Wrap Up

### Goals for next month - keep it stupid simple
* [Cadence Calculator](https://cadecalc.app) soft launch
* Write a [Hammerspoon](https://hammerspoonTODO.com) blog post
* Bikepacking planning

#### Cadence Calculator MVP
I started working on [Cadence Calculator](https://cadecalc.app) last summer. There's still a fair bit of work to be done, and I'm hoping that by the end of this month, I can begin to onboard a few interested users (that is, if there are interested users) into a pilot program. I'll write a blog post about this project soon for anyone interested.

#### Hammerspoon Blog Post
I'd like to get into the habit of publishing blog posts more often. I'm going to try to write one blog post this month (in addition to what you're currently reading). One is enough to make me struggle with setting aside the time to write, but not overwhelming.

#### Bikepacking planning
Maybe change ^^^
