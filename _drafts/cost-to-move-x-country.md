How I spent $5,xxx over 12 days moving from Cambridge, MA to Seattle, WA last summer.

## August 25, 2022
I typically don't go climbing, let alone wake up, at this hour, but I had 1 more day pass to the climbing gym, and I felt like I would be wasting the pass if I didn't use it. I made sure to use gym's Wi-Fi to download offline Google Maps on [my phone](/coming_soon) because I wasn't able to at home since I prematurly terminated my internet service.

I knew that Budget opened at 8am, so I made sure to get there right as they were opening. I showed up to Budget right as they were opening and spoke with the woman at the counter. Turns out you need some sort of insurance to rent a van? so on top of the 1700$ I agreed to pay online, I had to pay an extra ~800$ in person!!! Had I known that, I probably would've factore that into the prices of the other rental cars that I was looking at, and I may've ended up going with a different company.

I begrudgingly paid for the insurance after attempting to convince the woman that I already had my own insurance, but I wasn't able to provide some important insurance number, so that was a failed attempt at convincing her.

At around 8:20am, I was on the road en route to my apartment with my bicycle in the back. I showed up to my apartment around 8:30, and a few minutes after, my TaskRabbitter arrived. I wasn't sure how long it would take to pack the van - when I moved in about a year prior, it took probably an hour with the help of my parents to move everything that I brought in. So I booked the TaskRabbiter for an hour. After an hour, it was clear that there was still more work to be done, so I opted to ask if he was willing to help for an additional hour. He agreed and at around 10:30, we were all just about finished. I paid him for the 2nd hour outside the app - I hope I didn't jeporadize his job by doing this. If TaskRabbit didn't take a cut, I probably would've gone through the app, but I felt like he would benefit more from paying him directly.

I spent about another hour grabbing the last few boxes, sweeping, and doing final checks. At 11:30am, I was out the door. I called in a sandwich from the sandwich place and went to drop off my keys. After dropping my keys off, I went back to pick up my sandwich, and started my drive down to New London at 12pm.

I had a reservation on the 2:00pm ferry. Google Maps gave me an inital arrival time of 1:57pm, so I was worried I'd miss my boat. I quickly learned that my van was equipped with a [governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(device)), so I had the pedal to the floor most of the time doing a cool 75mph. I eventually arrived in New London, CT at 1:51pm, so I was happy to have a bit more buffer than I anticipated. I didn't remember that the ferry requires that you arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled departure until I started speaking with the ferry attendant. The attendant told me they were being nice and allowed me to board the ferry that I purchased a spot on for in advance. I did need to pay a surcharge in the office before boarding becuase I incorrectly recorded the size of my van.

Once I had my ticket from the office I boarded the ferry and could breathe. At 2:14pm, the ferry finally departed. 

That's all I wrote down

what'd i do afterwards?

after ferry, first stop was at the inn. picked up a cherry side table and some totes, maybe? Maybe got some food, then continued on

Official plan was maybe to maybe airbnb somewhere in pennsylvania

ended up driving all of LI, through NYC. Then after getting into Pennsylvania, started to look for a place to grab dinner. It was a lot harder to find food on maps than I imagined, but ended up stopping at a shopping mall and found a chipotle that was still open. Got food and tried to figure out where I Was going to stay the night. Airbnb idea didn't seem plausible becuase it was so late, maybe 9pm. I definitely didn't want to pay for a hotel, so I found a campsite in the middle fo pennsylvania. I decided I'd sty there and continued on driving. 




## August 26, 2022

At around 1/2am, I was still a few hours away from the campsite, and was getting pretty tired. I had stayed up until 3/4am the night before packing, so I wasn't running on a lot of sleep. I ended up pulling off an exit and parking at a truck rest stop. The first place I parked, some guy from inside this dingy looking building on the truck stop came out and told me I couldn't park there!? So then I moved the van over by the rest of the trucks. The parking lot surface was really shit. lots of pot holes. I ended up parking there and trying to sleep. I didn't sleep well, but slept for a few hours. 

At around 4am, I woke back up and didn't feel super tired and didn't think I'd get much more rest.

I continued on driving for another hour or so until I felt more tired. This time I stopped at a McDonalds parking lot and parked to sleep. I'm not sure if I found a better position in the drivers seat, but I managed to sleep for another few hours and at 7am, I was back awake and ready to go. I got out to walk around for a minute before starting the longest drive on day 2.

I got breakfast at McDonald's.

what the hell is a tollway?

truck driver angry with me becuase i passed the place where I was supposed to receive a ticket for entering the tollway. I've never driven on one of these before! They look so much like E-Z pass. I figured my e-z pass would pay the toll; i guess not!

I got lunch at this place south of chicago . i think it was near Purdue? I didn't know that's where Purdue was. It was a mexican place, pretty good food. The city felt so American - so many cars and businesses.

Eventually made it to the Chicago suburbs. Maddie arranged for me to park my van at her Grandmother's house. I met her Nona and got a quick tour of her house. Then I went to retreive my pre-packed bag of things for my little stay in Chicago. Unfortunately, I didn't know wehere the bag was, so after about 20 minutes of searching, I gave up and packed another small bag with clothes and necessities.

As I was lacing up my shoes for dinner, I noticed that my feet felt strange. I'd worn these shoes regularly, but I wasn't sure why they felt differnet all of a sudden. I took a closer look at my feet, and I noticed that my ankles were supppper swollen. My ankles wouldn't normally press up against the upper edge of my shoe, but now, they were! This made me pretty self-conscious about my ankles, but with pants and crew-length socks, it wasn't noticeale

We got sushi the first night at some place. This was my first time in Chicago - Maddie lives in B, so it was fun to walk around and see what it was all like.

Second day in Chicago - probably a Saturday
We went to the Greek festival - met up with MAddie's friends
also walked around downtown chicago.
then we went to the rooftop bar
then we went out to dinner at the nice greek restaurant

insert some pictures here

Insane pastries from Mindie's - coconut macaroon
Beach day - Chicago has beaches?
Started downpouring at the beach!
After the beach, went to get deep dish from _____ in _______. There was a pretty long wait, so we opted for the frozen deep dish and we baked it ourselves. It was pretttty good!

## August 29, 2022
Donuts before leaving
Took the L to the suburbs, tried to take a bus to Nona's street, but the bus never came after waiitng for like 25 minutes - Google said it had came, so I'm not sure what was going on. I ended up just calling a Lyft from the L station to Nona's. Van looked just like I had left it so threw my bag in and started driving!

I stopped at a bike shop on the way up North - I put my bike bibs in my chicago pack bag, and without my bike bibs, I knew my rides I had planned would be pretty miserable. So I bought a pair at a bike shop.

Then I tried Culver's for the first time! The cheese curds were realllly good! Also the ice cream thing I had was really good.

I had a weird interaction with another customer while I was waiitng for my food to be prepared. He started making conversation with me because he noticed I was wearing a hat that said Pocassett. He explained that when he was in college, he went on a study exchange to a college in Massachusetts. We were talking about Massachusetts when an employee from Culver's approached me to give me my food. When I turned to return to my conversation with the other customer, he was no where to be found.

That evening, I just kept driving west. The next stop on the trip was to hit Badlands, and it was right off I-80, so I just kept driving until I needed to . I tried to split the drive into realistic distances. Ended up stopping in Blue someething. I stopped at a McDonalds and hopped on their wifi to figure out where I'd sleep. I found a campground about 5 miles from the McDonalds, so I decided I'd stay there. I got take out from a local place and brought it to the campsite. I pulled up and met a nice groundsperson who took my info and got me set up with a campsite. I set up my bivvie and ate my food before heading to bed

TALK ABOUT THE INTERNET PHONE PLAN - tello - data limits - maybe say that i'll write a post about this in the future
## August 30, 2022

drive to the badlands

subway sandwich - wtfff - weird people. really expensive!

worried about gas becuase gas stations were sparse

got to badlands NP. Paid for year pass

parked at the first lot

got the bike out and started my ride.

really nice ride. really great roads, not a lot of cars. pretty warm.... made it to the turning point and heading back. i started getting pretty dehydrated. i brought 2 bottles with me but i think i didn't correclty plan for the heat. ended up making it to some visitor center thingy and getting my water bottle refilled which felt super refershing. made it back up to the car, packed up the bike and continued onwards.

grocery shopping - got hummus cucumber, weird latva bread, etc.

ben, maddie's friend, suggested a campsite to stay at in/near badlands. i plugged it into my gps and headed towards it


this campsite was pretty remote - had to take a long gravel road to get there. i was a bit worried at first with the van, but it seemed to handle it fine. made it to the campsite. probably was at half capacity. people all mostly kept to themselves. really cool moment around 6;30 - ALL THE animals started making this noise at once and all retreated into the ground. i had no idea that was going to happen.

ate my dinner, set up tent, slept

## August 31, 2022

left campsite pretty early ~6am

arrived to Keystone - city outside Mt Rushmore. Parked in first parking lot i saw - paid for parking, setup bike, and started on ride

sat down and got a slice of pie in **Hill City??** - not sure this is accurate. then ride down to the **CUster Park** wasn't super scenic - alongside highway. there was a car accident at the top of the hill? and emergency personell let me pass and bomb the hill before cars were allowed to contine which was nice of them. the park was super nice to ride through. close to the top of one of the peaks, i stopped to take pictures/ take a break and a nice couple offered me a cold water bottle which was super appreciated. chatted with them for a bit - if i recall, they weree on a road trip of their own. can't remember now where they were coming from / going. i think they mentinoed something about a military base? not sure

after water break, biked out of the custer park and was en route to rushmoore. had my first peaks at the statue (statue?) on the road up to the park entrance. biked in (didn't have to pay for parking, hell yeah) and walked around. bought a coca cola. walked to the photo op for the pic - underwhelming as others have shared, but glad i went.

quick downhill back to the car. packed up and off north

stopped at a little lake an hour into the drive. hopped in to bathe quickly - get sweat / dust off and continued on.

i think i got a burrito????? somewhere?

it was a pretty boring drive up to roosevelt national park - going north not on a major highway so single lane dotted line roads which i dislike

got to the park at sunset - really pretty landscape - bison!! blocking the road. set up camp, made food - hummus brownie cool ranch doritos, slept

## September 1, 2022

not sure if i had a komoot ride planned. started ride around 7am. ran into a sign that advised cars to reroute - i misread and thought it meant that pedestrians and walkers were permitted to walk around, and only cars were blocked from continuing. a few miles in, after trying to ignore all of the animal droppings, i ran into a road outage. thought it was a bit strange that they'd allow pedestrians to cross this. didn't try to think much of this - carefully walked my bike off the side of the road across the outage and continued on. ANOTHER outage another mile or two up the road - well at this point, do i turn around and cross the sketchy crossing again, or continue past this one and hope it's the last? so i continued and a bit later, i saw a matching road closure sign and the rest of the ride was really nice! saw maybe 1 other cyclist out? pretty nice ride and roads.

started drive once i returned and packed up bike

got poke bowl outside of bozeman/livingston montana

arrived to livingston

stopped by the library andddddd , idk. did something on WIFI? I can't remember why i needed to do that

got take out sandwich from a local place

drove to campsite - reccomended by college friend who grew up in bozeman. cool live music and scenic spot. chatted with one guy - i remember him saying that he really liked Montana and he would want to live there. idk

fucking freaked out at night becuase i thought i heard a mountain lion right outside my tent. had trouble falling asleep after that, but nothing ended up happening - lucky me

## September 2, 2022

left around 7am

went to bozeman for breakfast at a well rated diner - got a cinnamon roll to go

stopped at a antique / thrift/ other store on the drive up to glacier

really pretty drive into glacier. stopped at the grocery store outside the entrance to get food for dinner. my camping plans fell apart - i thought i'd hike in a few miles and camp at a site i saw on a map, but all of the spots were already reserved when i arrived, so i popped the bike togehter and rode to the park ranger station - asked what was still available. got some info there, biked back and drove to an open spot. set up camp, ate and slept

really cold night - probably could've used a warmer sleeping bag. i think i was wearing my jacket and hat and still wasn't enough. makes sense because sleeping bag is rated for summer and glacier at night then dropped to 40s? 30s? idk

## September 3, 2022

woke up cold. packded up and drove to trailhead

saw a mountain goat next to where i parked van for the run!

did a little trail run to this lake that was closed off so detoured up to dragon's den? or something? kinda sketchy to run on, but was really pretty

finished with run. drove west out of glacier natinoal park. Really incredible views. Would be a great bike ride

drove out of park and onto Spokane

stopped in Wallace, ID for lunch - got mexican? checked out an outdoor market that was going on while waiting for my food. had a really old miner townie feel. kinda funny that arket was under the I90 bridge

drove into spokane. Stopped at a movie theater becuase i think it was national movie theater day and things i was seeing online said that tickets were 1$? I drove to a theater that was showing marcel the shell with shoes on and made it just as the movie was starting. Paid full price for a ticket, so i guess they werent' doing the promo

after movie, went to grocery store across the street, then mcdonalds to eat, get wifi/charge up, and then went to campsite outside spokane

ate dinner and slept

## September 4, 2022

drove back into spokane - parked closer to city center. put bike together and started ride. went north along river, than across bridge and back down. really nice ride - good temp, well shaded. really fun ride back into the city - slight downhill riding with cars

got breakfast at this coffee place? Realllllly good vegan donuts and sweets?? really good

then drove to seattle!

arrived to apartment around 2:30 - keys were stashed for me. unpacked the van in less than an hour by myself besides 2/3 larger things i had another taskrabbiter help me with. taskrabbiter helped me for a few minutes and then i sent him on his way.

took van and drove to trader joes / target to get groceries / things i needed to set up.

wifi router, etc.

BestFoods != Hellman's???!?!?!?

refilled gas

parked empty van on the street

frozen pizza for dinner

## September 5, 2022

the end
